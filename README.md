## Learnt the following:

## Review Day 13:

### 1. Variables and Constants
  - var - store temporary data of any type that can change throughout the program
  - let - A constant value is set thoughout the program and the value cannot be changed
  - var should be all small and camel case
  - let constant should be all caps
  
### 2. Data Types
  - Int, Double, String...
  - Implicit (Swift understands) and Explicit(we say it explicitky) annotation using : DataType
  - When the variable is declared using a type then it should only assigned a value of that type
  - have space after : var variable: DataType
  - Float precision is lesser than Double
  - Boolean true or false - only 2 states

### 3. Operators
  - + - * / += (add and store the value)
  - preferable to do operations only between apples to apple
  - modulo - reminder operator
  - Comparision operators - < > <= >= == !=     -->Return Booleans
  - swift is case sensitive when comparing strings or even when creating variable names
  - Add parenthesis between operations to avoid ambiguity

### 4. String Interpolation
  - When you wanna include the variable or constant inside a string use `\(variableName)` to have a value
